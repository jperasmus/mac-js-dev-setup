# mac-js-dev-setup
A very opinionated script to setup my JavaScript developer environment on a new Mac.

# Usage
```
cd ~/Downloads && curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/jperasmus/mac-js-dev-setup/tarball | tar -zxvf-
```

Then `cd` into the downloaded repo directory (something like jperasmus-mac-js-dev-setup-d0d4515)

```
cd jperasmus-mac-js-dev-setup-d0d4515
```

Run install script

```
sh ./install.sh
```

Sit back and let it run.
